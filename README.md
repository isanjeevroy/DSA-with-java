## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive guide for mastering Java and DSA. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or just looking to improve your problem-solving skills, this repo provides the necessary materials and code examples to enhance your understanding.

## Java Concepts

In this section, you'll find Java programs that cover fundamental and advanced concepts of Java programming, organized into different categories:

- **Java Basics**: Learn the basics of Java, including data types, operators, and control structures.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Explore key OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
- **Collections Framework**: Get familiar with Java's powerful collection classes like List, Set, Map, and Queue.
- **Advanced Java**: Delve into more complex topics like multitasking, multiprocessing, and multithreading.

## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This section covers various data structures and algorithms, complete with Java implementations and explanations:

- **Arrays**: Sorting, searching, and other fundamental operations on arrays.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations and operations on singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks**: Learn about stack data structure and its implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- **Queues**: Understand queue operations and their implementations in Java.
- **Trees**: Work with binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversals.
- **Graphs**: Explore graph-related algorithms including BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra.
- **Other DSA Topics**: Additional topics like hashing, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking.

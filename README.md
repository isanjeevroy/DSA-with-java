## Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive guide for mastering Java and DSA. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or just looking to improve your problem-solving skills, this repo provides the necessary materials and code examples to enhance your understanding.

## Java Concepts

In this section, you'll find Java programs that cover fundamental and advanced concepts of Java programming, organized into different categories:

- **[Java Basics](Java-Concepts/01_Basics/)**: Learn the basics of Java, including data types, operators, and control structures.
- **[Object-Oriented Programming](Java-Concepts/02_ObjectOrientedProgramming/)**: Explore key OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
- **[Collections Framework](Java-Concepts/03_Collections/)**: Get familiar with Java's powerful collection classes like List, Set, Map, and Queue.
- **[Advanced Java](Java-Concepts/04_Advanced/)**: Delve into more complex topics like multitasking, multiprocessing, and multithreading.

## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This section covers various data structures and algorithms, complete with Java implementations and explanations:

- **[Arrays](DSA/01_Arrays/)**: Sorting, searching, and other fundamental operations on arrays.
- **[Linked Lists](DSA/02_LinkedLists/)**: Implementations and operations on singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **[Stacks](DSA/03_Stacks/)**: Learn about stack data structure and its implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- **[Queues](DSA/04_Queues/)**: Understand queue operations and their implementations in Java.
- **[Trees](DSA/05_Trees/)**: Work with binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversals.
- **[Graphs](DSA/06_Graphs/)**: Explore graph-related algorithms including BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra.
- **[Other DSA Topics](DSA/07_OtherDSA/)**: Additional topics like hashing, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking.
